        Consisting of four columns containing 100 words relating life and death with different actions, emotions, and colors, this simultaneously lights and hues epitomize the human experience.<br> One phrase after another flash on and off individually, followed by each column lit up, and culminating in the illumination of the entire piece, creating a visual symphony that characterizes. </p>

       <a href=" https://www.celineparkgallery.com/blank-page-1"> Celine Park</a><br>
       The project is a 20-minute performance directed and designed by Céline  Park. It is a collaborative project with various artists and a scientist.<br>The project speculates a fictional scenario of ‘What if … marriage to objects conformed more strictly to the societal rules?’ <br> In this project, Céline has imagined a dystopian society where objectophiles can only marry the objects they love once they are qualified.</p>

         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=SZTTPS0pgQI&feature=emb_logo">ETERNAL RECURRENCE</a><br>
         SOGANG MEDIA LAB(Professor Moon-Ryul Jung)<br>
        Clouds become droplets, droplets fall on the ground and flow, the flowing water evaporates, and the vapor forms clouds to start yet another cycle. <br> This ever-repeating cycle of water can be expressed with the phrase “Eternal Recurrence.”<br> This piece borrows the eternal recurrence of water drops to express the cycle of human life in which one is born to the world, advances through life, <br> seeks true freedom and happiness that transcend the confines of reality, and tries to leave beautiful memories of that life.</p>
            


        <h2 style="font-family:futura;">read "Critical Making", pick 3 quotes from the text and write 1 paragraph response for each</h2>
    <p><p style="font-family:futura;">
        Quote 1 <br>
        "Critical making is less about the aesthetics and politics of design work<br>
        and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and conceptual exploration."<br>

        - <br>
        Since designers are usually obsessed with thinking about how to show, how it looks, <br> the idea of how Critical Making is not the result but more about the process was very interesting.<br> I also wonder about the possibility of viability or solution-oriented kind of aspect of these practices.<br>
        and if this could be some form of speculative design practice.<br> 

    </p>


    <p> <p style="font-family:futura;">
        Quote 2 <br>
        "However, by constructing their own PRM system and having to make decisions about how it might function,<br> they not only felt that they increased their knowledge, but they also became more invested and in a sense responsible for the adoption and use of DRM.<br>
        -<br> 
        This quote shows the value of Critical Making teaching method by showing actual examples. <br>
        However, how could this kind of practice method being applied to other courses other than engineering?<br>
        How open design tools can be helpful in this aspect? <br> 
        
    
    </p>

    
    <p><p style="font-family:futura;">
        Quote 3 <br>
        "As a teaching and a research method, critical making is thus dependent on open design methods, tools and communities.<br> To put it most simply, the expertise necessary to create prototypes and engage in processes of software and hardware construction must be open <br> and available in order to allow for the kinds of critically engaged practices described above."<br>
