        The project is a 20-minute performance directed and designed by Céline  Park. It is a collaborative project with various artists and a scientist. The project speculates a fictional scenario of ‘What if … marriage to objects conformed more strictly to the societal rules?’ In this project, Céline has imagined a dystopian society where objectophiles can only marry the objects they love once they are qualified.


    <p> ETERNAL RECURRENCE<br>
        (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=SZTTPS0pgQI&feature=emb_logo)<br>
        SOGANG MEDIA LAB(Professor Moon-Ryul Jung)<br>
        Clouds become droplets, droplets fall on the ground and flow, the flowing water evaporates, and the vapor forms clouds to start yet another cycle. This ever-repeating cycle of water can be expressed with the phrase “Eternal Recurrence.” This piece borrows the eternal recurrence of water drops to express the cycle of human life in which one is born to the world, advances through life, seeks true freedom and happiness that transcend the confines of reality, and tries to leave beautiful memories of that life.
