        <h2>reading "Experiments"</h2>
            <p>
                “We learned quickly that exposed viewpoints are not good listening points, as they are contaminated
                by air and road traffic. But over the day we gathered a good collection of sounds for transmission.” </p>

                    It seems as if a contrast is drawn between the places from which the sounds were collected, such as bird songs, water sounds, and animal sounds, and those “exposed viewpoints” where air and traffic pollution abounds. I was wondering how to define “exposed viewpoints” and what some of the examples are that fall into this category? 
                    
                     <p>
                    “Our calls remained unanswered. People ignored the ringing phones, and if they did answer soon hung up. With several of our team observing the phone booths we were by now targeting directly, we realised that the phones were only answered when somebody was in the booth about to make a call anyway.”</p>
                    The result of this experiment seems very alarming to me, prompting me to question what considerations had gone neglected in the preparation phases of the experiment. In other words, what could have been done differently in order for the experiment to go as the researchers expected? To be more specific, how can we effectively address, or alleviate, the psychological burden that insiders/informants/participants of the research study might feel?
                    
                    <p>
                    “Despite the almost complete failure of the test we were paradoxically enthused by the experience. …
                    As an occasion for evaluation, the Digital Boudoir experiment was clearly a failure. But as an opportunity to advance our thinking, it was useful and even inspiring.”
                    I think that this quote represents a great lesson. Despite self-perceived failures, or maybe even because of those, we can always find something useful and inspiring. Maybe the value of the experiment is for gaining new insights and thinking from trials and errors.

                <h2>reading "What do Prototypes Prototype?"</h2>
                <p>
                2p
                “What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them,
                but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.”
                </p>
                <p>
                This gave me new insight about the concept of prototype, because it is normally considered that the prototype is defined as a prototype if and only if characterized by certain types of software tools. At the same time, I am concerned about the possibility of confusion that might arise due to conflicting perceptions of a prototype between a designer and a user. In other words, something that is conceived of as a prototype by a designer might not be perceived as such by users. How do we address such a disparity in perception?
            </p>
            <p>
                5p
                “In fact, these three prototypes were developed almost in parallel. They were built by different design team members during the early stages of the project. No single prototype could have represented the design of the future artifact at that time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                This quote was interesting to me, because it directs attention to the fact that the role, the looks and feels, and the implementation of a prototype are not a sequential process. In fact, they can take place in parallel. My question is, is this the case in practice? How do we know that we think through various considerations simultaneously, rather than separately? 
            </p> <p>
                14p
                “It was highly motivating to users to be able to manipulate real user data through a novel user interface, and much was learned about the design. However, the designers also felt that they had to invest a large amount of time in making the prototype, yet had only been able to support a very narrow role compared to the breadth shown in the animation shown in Example 8. Many broader design questions remained unanswered.”
            </p><p>
                This is the problem I feel about prototyping as a designer. Sometimes in order to make the prototyping process both efficient and effective, it takes too much time and effort that sometimes fail to lead us to successful results. This brings me to a question about ‘What is a prototype?’ I also wonder how detailed prototyping should be and how do we know what is enough in terms of the scope of a prototype?

            <h2>reading "Hacker hacked"</h2>
            <p>
                Quote 1 <br>
                "Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems – about the world –
                from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge
                to create new and even more interesting things."
            </p>
            <p>
                I think this is an important statement because it shows the author's point of view about hacker spirit, such as in what way hacker ethic is important and why should be valued. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Quote 2 <br>
                " It seems safe to say, though, that it’s not very hacker-like to aspire to conventional empowerment, to get a job at a blue-chip company while reading The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
                The hacker impulse is critical. It defies, for example, corporate ambitions."
            </p>
            <p>
                It is an argument that can see the author has a more romantic view of hacker culture 
                and that it's about freedom, understanding complex systems, and disregarding authority.    
            </p>


            <p>
                Quote 3 <br>
                " I’m going to stake a claim on the word though, and state that the true hacker spirit does not reside at Google, guided by profit targets. The hacker impulse should not just be about redesigning products, or creating ‘solutions’. A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all. It’s just a piece of business innovation."
            </p>
            <p>
                it seems a very bold and strong statement. The author says that "A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all" and it brings me a question about what is "anti-conventional" really mean. Is anything that makes a profit and business-oriented ideas could be considered as an "anti-conventional"?

                <h2>reading "Critical Making"</h2>
            <p></p>
                Quote 1 <br>
                "Critical making is less about the aesthetics and politics of design work
                and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and conceptual exploration."<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since designers are usually obsessed with thinking about how to show, how it looks, the idea of how Critical Making is not the result but more about the process was very interesting. I also wonder about the possibility of viability or solution-oriented kind of aspect of these practices. and if this could be some form of speculative design practice.

            </p>


            <p>
                Quote 2 <br>
                "However, by constructing their own PRM system and having to make decisions about how it might function, they not only felt that they increased their knowledge, but they also became more invested and in a sense responsible for the adoption and use of DRM.<br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                This quote shows the value of Critical Making teaching method by showing actual examples.
                However, how could this kind of practice method being applied to other courses other than engineering?
                How open design tools can be helpful in this aspect? <br>   

            </p>

            
            <p>
                Quote 3 <br>
                "As a teaching and a research method, critical making is thus dependent on open design methods, tools and communities.To put it most simply, the expertise necessary to create prototypes and engage in processes of software and hardware construction must be open and available in order to allow for the kinds of critically engaged practices described above."<br>
