        <h2>reading "Hacker hacked"</h2>
        <p>
            Quote 1 <br>
            "Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems – about the world – <br>
            from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge <br>
            to create new and even more interesting things."
            - <br>
            I think this is an important statement because it shows the author's point of view about hacker spirit, <br> such as in what way hacker ethic is important and why should be valued. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Quote 2 <br>
            " It seems safe to say, though, that it’s not very hacker-like to aspire to conventional empowerment,<br> to get a job at a blue-chip company while reading The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.<br> 
            The hacker impulse is critical. It defies, for example, corporate ambitions."
            - <br>
            It is an argument that can see the author has a more romantic view of hacker culture <br> 
            and that it's about freedom, understanding complex systems, and disregarding authority.<br>     
        </p>


        <p>
            Quote 3 <br>
            " I’m going to stake a claim on the word though, and state that the true hacker spirit does not reside at Google, guided by profit targets. <br> The hacker impulse should not just be about redesigning products, or creating ‘solutions’. <br> A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all. <br>It’s just a piece of business innovation."
            <br>
            - it seems a very bold and strong statement. The author says that "A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all" <br> and it brings me a question about what is "anti-conventional" really mean. <br> Is anything that makes a profit and business-oriented ideas could be considered as an "anti-conventional"? <br>

       The project is a 20-minute performance directed and designed by Céline  Park. It is a collaborative project with various artists and a scientist.<br>The project speculates a fictional scenario of ‘What if … marriage to objects conformed more strictly to the societal rules?’ <br> In this project, Céline has imagined a dystopian society where objectophiles can only marry the objects they love once they are qualified.</p>

        Clouds become droplets, droplets fall on the ground and flow, the flowing water evaporates, and the vapor forms clouds to start yet another cycle. <br> This ever-repeating cycle of water can be expressed with the phrase “Eternal Recurrence.”<br> This piece borrows the eternal recurrence of water drops to express the cycle of human life in which one is born to the world, advances through life, <br> seeks true freedom and happiness that transcend the confines of reality, and tries to leave beautiful memories of that life.</p>
            


        <h2>read "Critical Making", pick 3 quotes from the text and write 1 paragraph response for each</h2>
    <p>
        Quote 1 <br>
        "Critical making is less about the aesthetics and politics of design work<br>
        and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and conceptual exploration."<br>

        - <br>
        Since designers are usually obsessed with thinking about how to show, how it looks, <br> the idea of how Critical Making is not the result but more about the process was very interesting.<br> I also wonder about the possibility of viability or solution-oriented kind of aspect of these practices.<br>
        and if this could be some form of speculative design practice.<br> 

    </p>


    <p> 
        Quote 2 <br>
        "However, by constructing their own PRM system and having to make decisions about how it might function,<br> they not only felt that they increased their knowledge, but they also became more invested and in a sense responsible for the adoption and use of DRM.<br>
        -<br> 
        This quote shows the value of Critical Making teaching method by showing actual examples. <br>
        However, how could this kind of practice method being applied to other courses other than engineering?<br>
        How open design tools can be helpful in this aspect? <br>   

    </p>

    
    <p>
        Quote 3 <br>
        "As a teaching and a research method, critical making is thus dependent on open design methods, tools and communities.<br> To put it most simply, the expertise necessary to create prototypes and engage in processes of software and hardware construction must be open <br> and available in order to allow for the kinds of critically engaged practices described above."<br>
