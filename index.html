                Quote 1 <br>
                "Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems – about the world –
                from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge
                to create new and even more interesting things."
            </p>
            <p class="opinion">
                I think this is an important statement because it shows the author's point of view about hacker spirit, such as in what way hacker ethic is important and why should be valued.

                Quote 2 <br>
                " It seems safe to say, though, that it’s not very hacker-like to aspire to conventional empowerment, to get a job at a blue-chip company while reading The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
                The hacker impulse is critical. It defies, for example, corporate ambitions."
            </p>
            <p class="opinion">
                It is an argument that can see the author has a more romantic view of hacker culture 
                and that it's about freedom, understanding complex systems, and disregarding authority.

                Quote 3 <br>
                " I’m going to stake a claim on the word though, and state that the true hacker spirit does not reside at Google, guided by profit targets. The hacker impulse should not just be about redesigning products, or creating ‘solutions’. A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all. It’s just a piece of business innovation."
            </p>
            <p class="opinion">
                it seems a very bold and strong statement. The author says that "A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is not a hack at all" and it brings me a question about what is "anti-conventional" really mean. Is anything that makes a profit and business-oriented ideas could be considered as an "anti-conventional"?

                Quote 1 <br>
                "Critical making is less about the aesthetics and politics of design work
                and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and conceptual exploration."<br>
            </p>
            <p class="opinion">
                Since designers are usually obsessed with thinking about how to show, how it looks, the idea of how Critical Making is not the result but more about the process was very interesting. I also wonder about the possibility of viability or solution-oriented kind of aspect of these practices. and if this could be some form of speculative design practice.

                This quote shows the value of Critical Making teaching method by showing actual examples.
                However, how could this kind of practice method being applied to other courses other than engineering?
                How open design tools can be helpful in this aspect? <br>

                "As a teaching and a research method, critical making is thus dependent on open design methods, tools and communities.To put it most simply, the expertise necessary to create prototypes and engage in processes of software and hardware construction must be open and available in order to allow for the kinds of critically engaged practices described above."<br>
